Created by Damizon • 2025

🎯 What Is Prompter2
Prompter is a tool for creating high-quality prompts for Stable Diffusion in English.
The program automatically translates entered phrases into English from over 70 languages.
After filling in the required fields, the program builds the prompt in the correct order and translates it.
It is not necessary to fill in all fields—just use those you currently need.

📝 How to Use the Program:

Fill in the text fields with descriptions:

Main subject, style, technique, lighting, background, etc.
Use commas to separate each element of the prompt. This helps the AI treat them as separate features or instructions.
Avoid periods (.)—they are not needed.
Quotation marks have no special meaning.

Word weight is its importance in the prompt.
The higher the weight, the more the AI will focus on that word.
To use weights:

Highlight the text and use the [+] or [–] buttons to change word weights.

Example: (cyberpunk:1.6) increases the importance of “cyberpunk.”

Example: (cyberpunk:0.6) decreases the importance of “cyberpunk.”
🔻 1.0 = normal
🔺 2.0 = very important
🔻 0.5 = less important

Click “Generate Prompt”:

The fields will be assembled into one prompt.

The text will be automatically translated into English.

The translated prompt will be copied to the clipboard.

Optional: Save the prompt as a TXT file.

💡 Tips:
• Combine short and long phrases (e.g., “portrait”, “Baroque style”).
• Use color and light to set the mood (e.g., “neon”, “sunset”).
• Experiment and preview the results!
